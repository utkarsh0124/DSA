There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.
It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].
You are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].
Return the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

Example 1:

Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]
Example 2:

Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
Output: [4,2,0,7,4]

```
    vector<int> decode(vector<int>& A, int cur) {
        vector<int> res = {cur};
        for (int& a: A)
            res.push_back(cur ^= a);
        return res;
    }
```

Explanation : 
According to Xor property
The inverse of XOR is XOR!

If you have:
c = a^b;
You can get a or b back if you have the other value available:
a = c^b; // or b^c (order is not important)
b = c^a; // or a^c

encoded[i] = arr[i] ^ arr[i+1]

Here we have an encoded array, and we want a resultant array, so we can interchange

res[0] = first
res[i+1] = res[i] ^ encoded[i]
